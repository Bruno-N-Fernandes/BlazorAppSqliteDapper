# BlazorAppSqlite

This is just a demo / sample project to show using SQLite in the browser with Blazor

It uses a pre-compiled version of SQLite taken from Steve Standersons original demo project (which means I dd not need to worry about compiling that myself)

@Gabriel123N has made a pull request which includes a demo of saving data to IndexedDB so when you refresh the browser the data is now lost
